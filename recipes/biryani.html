    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>1 kilogram (2 1/4 pounds) goat meat, preferably leg, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
           <li>6 tablespoons sunflower, canola, or vegetable oil, divided</li>
           <li>2 large red onions, finely chopped</li>
           <li>30 to 40 large curry leaves</li>
           <li>2 pepper green chilies, optional</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons coriander powder</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
           <li>2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
           <li>Salt, to taste</li>
           <li>2 cups hot water, divided</li>
           <li>50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) tamarind root</li>
           <li>700 grams (3 cups) basmati rice</li>
           <li>700 grams (3 cups) basmati rice</li>
           <li>2 drops orange food coloring, optional</li>
           <li>2 drops green food coloring, optional</li>
         </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the goat meat with the garlic and ginger pastes in a large bowl and mix well to coat the meat with the pastes. Set aside for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the meat is marinating, heat 3 tablespoons cooking oil in a large, deep pot or pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions and fry until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the curry leaves and green chilies, if using, and fry for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the powdered spices (coriander, cumin, turmeric, and garam masala) and salt to taste and mix well and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir often to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated meat. Stir well and often and cook until the meat is browned.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 cups of hot water, stir, cover, and simmer until meat is tender. Keep checking at this stage as you do not want the meat overcooked and soft.</li>
            <li>While the meat is cooking, make the tamarind puree. Put the tamarind in a plastic or glass bowl and pour 1/2 cup of hot water over it. Allow the mixture to stand for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain the tamarind and water mixture through a sieve (do not use a very fine sieve) into a bowl to get tamarind puree. </li>
            <li>Add tamarind puree to the curry when you feel the meat is almost done. Stir well. Once the meat is cooked, set it aside and prepare the rice.</li>
            <li>Put the rice in a colander and wash under running water until the water runs clear. Place in a large, deep cooking pot (preferably one with handles).</li>
            <li>Add enough water to fully cover the rice, usually at least 4 inches over the surface of the rice. Add 1 teaspoon of salt (or to taste). Bring the rice to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook rice until almost done. (To determine when it has reached that stage, remove a few grains from the pot and press between your thumb and forefinger. The rice should mostly mash but will have a firm, whitish core.) Turn off the heat and strain through a colander and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry the thinly sliced onions until caramelized and golden brown. Drain and set aside on paper towels for later use.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven or grill to 350 F/180 C and grease a deep dish or pot (which has a well-fitting cover). Evenly layer the cooked rice and the meat (with its gravy) in the dish to form at least two sets of layers (rice-meat-rice-meat-rice). Garnish with the caramelized onions.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish tightly. If your dish does not have a cover use two layers of aluminum foil (shiny side of both layers facing down toward the rice) and secure onto a dish with baking string. If you are using a handi (a deep pot with a nicely fitting lid) which has a flat rim, you can seal it by making a firm dough with flour and water and pressing this over the joint of the handi's rim and cover. Place the dish in the oven and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the oven or barbecue and let the dish sit in the oven or barbecue until you are ready to eat. It's important that you only open when you are ready to serve. The way to serve biryani is to gently dig in with a spoon so you get through the layers.</li>
